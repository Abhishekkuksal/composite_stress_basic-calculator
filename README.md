I will shortly update this section as i am still learning the Github.

This report is intended only to be used as a quick reference guide on the mechanics of 
continuous fiber-reinforced laminates. By continuous fiber-reinforced laminates, the following is 
assumed: 
(1) The material to be examined is made up of one or more plies (layers), each ply consisting 
of fibers that are all uniformly paralle and continuous across the material. The plies have to be 
of the same thickness and the same material.
(2) The material to be examined is in a state of plane stress, i-e., the stresses and strains in 
the through-the-thickness direction are ignored. 
(3) The thickness dimension is much smaller than the length and width dimensions. 
An attempt is made in this report to develop a practical guide that can be easily referenced by 
the engineer who is not familiar with composite materials, or to aid those who have seen this subject 
matter before.
